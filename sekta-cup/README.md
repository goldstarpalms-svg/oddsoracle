### ML Lab

Train four models from the historical match data:

1. Match winner classifier
2. First-set Over 18.5 classifier
3. Total-points regressor
4. First-set-points regressor

The ML pipeline uses chronological pre-match features:

- rolling Elo
- career win rate
- recent form
- first-set win tendency
- first-set Over 18.5 tendency
- point-difference history
- total-points history
- direct H2H history

The app can use:

- `xgboost` if installed and selected
- scikit-learn `HistGradientBoosting` fallback

### Live Odds page

Prepared integration for [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/):

- list available odds sports/markets for your API key
- fetch odds for a chosen table-tennis/sport key
- flatten bookmaker/market/outcome odds into a table
- calculate implied probabilities for decimal or American odds
- export odds to CSV

Additional scaffold clients are included for:

- Pinnacle API
- Betfair API-NG

No API key is included. Add your own key through environment variables or Streamlit secrets.

### Data Sources page

The app includes a structured source registry for the links you provided:

- live scores and match history: Flashscore, SofaScore, LiveScore.in, BetExplorer, Scorebing
- betting odds: The Odds API, Pinnacle, Betfair
- table-tennis data: ITTF, World Table Tennis, TableTennis.Guide, Ratings Central
- ML: scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna, SHAP
- analysis: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Plotly
- training: Colab, Kaggle
- GitHub/research discovery links

Compliance note: the app does **not** blindly scrape websites. Use official APIs, licensed feeds, permitted exports, or manual imports.

### Setka Cup official link

Includes the official Setka Cup website link:

- <https://tabletennis.setkacup.com/en/>

The app currently performs a lightweight availability/status check only. If you obtain an official Setka API/feed or have permission to scrape structured data, plug it into `src/setka_live.py`.

### Colab notebook

A Google Colab starter notebook is included:

```text
notebooks/Setka_ML_Training_Colab.ipynb
```

Use it to train models in Colab, download a `.joblib` model bundle, then place it in `models/`.

## Data currently included

- `data/Setka_June_2025_to_Now.csv`
  - 155,715 matches
  - date range: 2025-06-01 to 2026-07-24
  - score strings parsed into total points, first-set points, sets played, etc.
- `data/setka_leaderboard.csv`
  - leaderboard rows with Elo and match counts

## Run locally

```bash
cd setka-prediction-app
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## CLI helpers

```bash
# Upcoming official Setka predictions
python scripts/live_predictions.py --limit 20

# Official result/live-score check
python scripts/check_results.py --date 2026-07-25 --period all
```

## Permanent tracker storage

For Strong Pick Tracker and Daily Results Store to survive Streamlit redeploys, add GitHub-backed storage in Streamlit secrets:

```toml
GITHUB_STORAGE_TOKEN = "your_fine_grained_github_token"
GITHUB_STORAGE_REPO = "goldstarpalms-svg/Sekta-cup"
GITHUB_STORAGE_BRANCH = "app-storage"
GITHUB_STORAGE_PREFIX = "data/app_state"
```

Use a fine-grained GitHub token with **Contents: Read and write** for this repo only. The app uses `app-storage` branch so saved picks/results do not trigger Streamlit redeploys from `main`.

## Add API keys

### Environment variables

```bash
export THE_ODDS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export PINNACLE_USERNAME="your_username"
export PINNACLE_PASSWORD="your_password"
export BETFAIR_APP_KEY="your_app_key"
export BETFAIR_SESSION_TOKEN="your_session_token"
streamlit run app.py
```

### Streamlit secrets

Copy:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml.example
```

to:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Then set your keys. `secrets.toml` is ignored by Git and should not be committed.

## Train ML models from command line

Quick training with the latest 50,000 orientation rows:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --algorithm auto --max-training-rows 50000
```

Full training:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --algorithm auto --max-training-rows 0
```

Save path defaults to:

```text
models/setka_ml_bundle.joblib
```

Model artifacts are ignored by Git because they can be regenerated.

## Optional ML tools

Install optional ML/research libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
```

Tune the winner model with Optuna:

```bash
python scripts/tune_winner_model.py --algorithm sklearn --trials 50 --max-training-rows 50000
```

Heavy deep-learning frameworks are separated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-deep-learning.txt
```

Recommended: install deep-learning frameworks only in Colab/Kaggle or a machine with enough disk/RAM.

## Use Google Colab

1. Push this project to GitHub.
2. Open `notebooks/Setka_ML_Training_Colab.ipynb` in Colab.
3. Change `REPO_URL` to your GitHub repo URL.
4. Run the notebook.
5. Download the trained `setka_ml_bundle.joblib` artifact if needed.

## Push to GitHub

After reviewing the files:

```bash
cd setka-prediction-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Setka prediction app with ML and odds integration"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
